Multifunctional Dictionary (MFD) is a data-driven Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) application built upon the .NET framework. It relies on a relational PostgreSQL backend to drive search and query functionality against the loaded datasets. Primarily, MFD exists to link translations from source texts such as the Hebrew Bible, to modern translated texts like the English King James Bible.
